# Namaste
I’m Sahana, currently working as a Data Scientist at Intuit Credit Karma. I've been using my creative mind to write since I was 12 or 13 years old. Born and raised in Bangalore, India, and now residing in the United States, I have a unique perspective on things. Most of the time, I simply jot my thoughts down on my phone’s Notes app. This website is a sincere attempt to document them.
